# node-dex

> A command line tool for managing passwords built on Node.js

**WAIT!**

This is a work in progress, it should not yet be used with any sensitive info. Some day Dex will happily store your passwords for you... but that day has not yet come.

# Usage

## CLI (TUI)

```shell
dex <dex-file>
```

This will start the dex repl. Follow the prompts from there :).
